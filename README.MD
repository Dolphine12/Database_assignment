# 📚 Bookstore Database Design & SQL Programming

## 🧾 Overview

This project simulates a real-world scenario where **Database Administrators** are tasked with building and managing a **MySQL database** for a bookstore.
This Project applys key skills in database design, normalization, table creation, querying, and user access control to build an efficient and secure system.

---

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies

- **MySQL** – Database management and SQL queries  
- **Draw.io** – For creating and visualizing the database schema  

---

## ✅ Prerequisites

You should be familiar with:
- Basic MySQL syntax and commands
- Creating and altering tables
- Understanding relational data structures and foreign keys
- User roles and permission management in MySQL

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

 1. Build a relational MySQL database to manage the operations of a bookstore.
 2. Create Users and assign roles and permissions
 This includes:
- Efficient storage and retrieval of books, authors, customers, orders, and shipping data
- Proper user access controls
- A normalized and query-optimized schema

---

## 🧱 Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Create a new MySQL database
2. Design and define table schemas with appropriate data types
3. Write SQL scripts to create all necessary tables
4. Set up user roles and permissions
5. Run test queries to validate data and structure
